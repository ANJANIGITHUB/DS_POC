Without doubt, Hotel Alessandra is one of the most centrally located hotels in Florence. In this privileged position, Hotel Alessandra offers a home away from home, with our friendly team and extensive knowledge of the local area. The hotel entrance is situated on the second floor of the building. You can reach the reception floor using the lift, small but working fine (in the 1400s buildings hadn't been designed with this in mind!) But please note that there are around 30 steps from the entrance on the street level to the departure of the lift. We very much look forward to seeing you! Andrea and Anna''')\n",

We were greeted by Monty (pretty sure that‚Äôs his nameüòÅ) and his joy and enthusiasm are contagious. This hotel is in a great location. Less than a five minute walk to Uffizi, five to seven to the Duomo, 15 to Academia. We only took a taxi to Piazzale Michelangelo (but mainly because I didn‚Äôt want to walk up that hill!). We walked down and back to the hotel, 10-15 minutes.When we were here in ‚Äò16, there was a lovely breakfast that included the usual Italian fare of meats, cheeses, yogurts, but they also has eggs, which we appreciated. This time, there were not as many people staying at the hotel (low season) so they delivered breakfast to our room. It was perfect! They asked how we wanted the eggs, and what else we preferred...loved my smiley face cappuccino! We had a room with a queen (at least) bed and modern bathroom. And, FYI, great tv options in English. There are some steps up to the first floor where the small lift is located. The owners could not have been more accommodating! Printed off vouchers for us, bought some wine from them, and just all around wonderful people. We would not stay anywhere else in Florence.''')"
